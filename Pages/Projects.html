                <h3>Project 1: Google Workspace Mastery</h3>
		  
		<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Recognized that the district operates as a Google Workspace district, but many teachers lacked understanding and training on how to effectively utilize its tools.</p>
   		<p><strong>Design:</strong> Created a structured training video focusing on Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Forms to address this gap and provide practical, classroom-focused solutions.</p>
		<p><strong>Development:</strong> Designed examples showcasing collaborative documents, interactive presentations, automated grade tracking, and self-grading quizzes to demonstrate the platform's potential.</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Delivered the training via a video demonstration. Due to student privacy, the video cannot be shared as it includes student names.</p>
		<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Collected feedback from educators to refine the training and ensure it effectively supports classroom efficiency and enhances teaching workflows.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Schoology Rundown</h3>
		<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Identified that while Schoology is the primary Learning Management System (LMS) used in the district, many educators struggle with its advanced features, limiting its potential to enhance student learning experiences.</p>
   		<p><strong>Design:</strong> Developed a comprehensive training plan to familiarize educators with Schoology's features, focusing on creating, organizing, and managing classroom materials efficiently. The training included step-by-step guides and hands-on activities.</p>
		<p><strong>Development:</strong> Prepared guided LMS tours, hands-on activities, and resource materials tailored to educatorsâ€™ specific needs. These resources emphasized practical application and were designed to support real-time problem-solving during the training sessions.</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Delivered the training program through in-person workshops and personalized one-on-one sessions. Participants were guided step-by-step, enabling them to gain confidence in navigating Schoology while addressing individual questions and concerns in real-time.</p>
		<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Collected direct feedback during one-on-one sessions and group workshops to measure training effectiveness. Adjustments were made based on participant input to ensure the training met their diverse needs and improved their ability to integrate Schoology into daily teaching practices.</p>
