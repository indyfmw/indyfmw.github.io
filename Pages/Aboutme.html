	<p class="aboutme">In a past life I’m sure I was a comic book character, going to galas and parties, while also fighting crime with my love Batman. But in my current life I am an aspiring software engineer, chilling to Low-Fi Beats while coding with my  Miniature Chihuahua, Mini sitting on my shoulder. Besides long walks away from beaches, I enjoy making video games, niche personal projects, Crocheting, knitting, and watching Law and Order: SVU with my mom. I attend University of North Texas as a Computer Science major with a History Minor. History as well as coding is another passion of mine. I love learning the origins of why and how things are today. 
	Another passion of mine is game designing, I am working on a personal project and I created a devlog (developers blog)  instagram to track my progress on building. With school being out I’m excited to commit more work into a personal project of mine. The name of my devlog is Pixelcorndev. Mostly because I love Unicorns and pixelated games (my favorite being undertale) :D. I hope you’re able to play what I put out in the near future.
