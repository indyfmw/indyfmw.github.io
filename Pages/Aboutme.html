	<h1 class="title">My Journey</h1>
	<div class="aboutme">
	<p>
When I was 15, I found myself in a challenging environment. Living with my grandmother, I often felt displaced, longing for stability and a sense of purpose. To escape, I envisioned a brighter future—dreams of becoming an astronomer, a brain surgeon, or even a lawyer. These ambitions, though fleeting at the time, taught me resilience and adaptability, qualities that would later define my path.</p>

<p>A turning point came when I moved with my mom to a one-bedroom apartment. For the first time, I had the chance to focus on my education. I was eager to succeed and remember diving into summer reading with excitement, only to be told that due to previous absences, I would need to attend an alternative school to graduate on time.</p>

<p>At this new school, I witnessed stark disparities in educational resources. My original high school had state-of-the-art technology and advanced classes, while the alternative school lacked even a librarian or modern computers. This experience opened my eyes to systemic inequalities in education—a revelation that has since shaped my professional journey.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, I thrived. I assisted teachers, won a coding competition, and graduated in the top 10% of my class, securing a place at any Texas state university. But college brought its own hurdles. The loss of my grandfather and a subsequent battle with depression marked a difficult chapter. Yet, it was during these struggles that I learned to persevere. Diagnosed with ADHD, I adapted, shifted my major to history, and rediscovered a love for learning.</p>

<p>When I became a teacher, I didn’t expect it to become my calling. Yet, in the classroom, I found purpose. I loved creating engaging lessons, fostering connections with my students, and being an advocate for their needs. One defining moment came when I discovered that a student in my class, who struggled with basic skills, had been misplaced in general education for years due to administrative oversight. That experience solidified my commitment to ensuring every learner has the support and resources they need to succeed.</p>

<h2 class="title">Why Instructional Design?</h2>

<div class="aboutme">
<p>		Teaching opened my eyes to the power of effective design in education. I realized that the way content is presented can mean the difference between confusion and clarity, between disengagement and empowerment. I chose to pursue instructional design because I want to create experiences that bridge gaps, inspire learners, and drive meaningful change.</p>

<p>		My story is one of perseverance, growth, and a deep belief that education can change lives when done right. I bring this passion to every project, striving to design solutions that are inclusive, engaging, and equitable for all learners. </p>

	<p>
		In my free time, I love indulging in my creative side through crocheting and crafting, diving into fantasy novels, and relaxing with YouTube or the cozy charm of Stardew Valley. Recently, I've rediscovered my passion for coding—building this very website has been such a joyful project!
